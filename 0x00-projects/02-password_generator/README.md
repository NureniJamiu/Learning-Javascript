**ABOUT THE PROJECT**

This project requires the knowledge of how to work with the following:

- Variables
- functions
- loops (for loops specifically)
- arrays (a profound knowledge of how it works)
- inbuilt methods (the likes of the 'Math.random' and 'Math.floor')
- Nesting
- HTML DOM

Creating this project is indeed a fun-filled experience. I got my chance to put what I've learned into practice. Thanks to scrimba.com for providing such a great resource to learn from.
